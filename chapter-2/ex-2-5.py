# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.

time_one = 6
f_time_one = float(time_one)

time_two = 10
f_time_two = float(time_two)

time_three = 15
f_time_three = float(time_three)

# Constant for the speed.

speed = 75


# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.
distance_one = time_one * speed
distance_two = time_two * speed
distance_three = time_three * speed




# Print the results for all calculations.

print(distance_one, distance_two, distance_three)
