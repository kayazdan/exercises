# Exercise 2-7

# Calculate the miles per gallon
# of a trip


# Inputs
trip_length = input("How many miles did you drive?: ")
f_trip_length = float(trip_length)

miles_pgallon = input("How many miles per gallon does your car get?: ")
f_miles_pgallon = float(miles_pgallon)


# Processing

total = f_trip_length/f_miles_pgallon

# Output
print(total)
